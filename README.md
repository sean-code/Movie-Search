## Project Description
This project was the development of a website application that provides a user with the ability to search all categories of movies.
The idea is to provide entertainment to the user. Furthermore, a user is able to compile a list of favorite movies. All of this among other amazing UI features are meant for entertainment.  The application is also Advert free.
The Project was done for the purpose of learning and to grasp hands-on skills in website application development using React JS, and as well interaction with a public application programming interface as part of my Software Engineering journey.

## Technology Used
This project was accomplished by the use of an API provided by OMDb™ . It requires me to use an Authentication key and therefore I cannot share it here. 
Also a custom made API: db.json was created to handle the backend for the feedback form. As shown below is a feedback being submitted on the form and how it appears on the backend.

- `Movie Search+` application was built using React JS technology, with the intermingling of JSX, custom CSS and Bootstrap.
